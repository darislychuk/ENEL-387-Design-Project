# ENEL-387-Design-Project
Microcontroller System Design Course

For this course I designed a barn alarm system using a STM32F100 microcontroller on a microprocessor board created in ENEL 384 (Digital Electronics). I used embedded C language to design this project. I did not end up meeting all the specifications outlined in my proposal within the time alotted, such as getting my UART display fully working. However, I decided to include the little bit of code I played around with when attempting to get it to work.
